# E-Retail
Simple application that uses electronic retail (**e-retail**) cases. This project separates the _Web UI_ and _Rest API_ as examples of best practices in creating real projects.
This project is based on the [Core Project](https://github.com/davidch93/core#core-project) as a high level abstraction project and dependencies management (**BOM**). 
So basically this will use **Spring Boot** and **Java 8** for both projects.
